# Welcome to The Quantitative Analyst

Welcome to my corner of the internet where data engineering meets financial markets. I'm an anonymous professional working at the intersection of genomics, data science, and quantitative trading.

## Why Anonymous?

I've chosen to remain anonymous for several reasons:

**Focus on Data, Not Personality**: Without a personal brand to maintain, I can share honest insights, failures, and real trading results without worrying about image management.

**Industry Freedom**: Anonymity allows me to discuss market strategies, company analyses, and trading approaches without potential conflicts of interest or employment concerns.

**Pure Insights**: You'll get unfiltered analysis based on data and experience, not influenced by personal networking or industry politics.

## My Background

I currently work as a data engineer at a genomics startup, where I build ML pipelines and data infrastructure for healthcare applications. My path here included:

- **Finance Foundation**: Degree in finance and years of experience in banking and financial services
- **Market Experience**: Active trader with focus on systematic strategies and biotech sectors
